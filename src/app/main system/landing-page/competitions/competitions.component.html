        <strong>
          Shell Eco-Marathon challenges student teams from around the world to design, build and test ultra-energy-efficient vehicles. The winners are the teams that go the furthest using the least amount of energy. The competition is split into two classes or categories. The Prototype class focuses on maximum efficiency, while passenger comfort takes a back seat. The Urban Electric Concept class encourages more practical designs, We have started in participation in prototype cataegory in 2013, in 2017 we started in participation in urban cataegory.</strong

        <strong>
          The mate ROV competition is, at its core, designed to be educational and inspirational event for students. It challenges them to think of themselves as entrepreneurs and transform their teams into companies that manufacture, market, and sell “products”. ROVs can be described as underwater robots. Their performance underwater depends on hydrodynamic behavior and naval
          architectural principles, We have started in participation since 2014.
          The competition has three stages, a local one in Cairo which qualifies competitors to the regional competition, ROV Arab in Alexandria, and then the third stage in NASA USA.
